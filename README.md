         short stories become popular.  A good story needs to attract readers, which should be vivid and coherent. For the reason that if a story is vivid, readers will feel like they were part of the story and experience the same feeling or in the same situation as writer. A coherent story helps readers to reads the story without cutoff by the blurred description
          If a story is vivid, it will trigger readers’ interest and make them to get further reading. For instance, the husband in Raymond Carver’s story ‘ Cathedral’, when the blind man ask the husband to describe what a cathedral looks like in the TV, the husband could not describe it at the beginning. After ecouraging by  the blind man ,the husband ables to draw the cathedral out. Later the writer shows us a picture that the blind man hold the husband’s hand and follow the hand movement to feel and understand how the cathedral looks like, and what components the cathedral should have, such as the grant arches and wide doors. the photo drew by the writer will pull the readers into  an amazing European middle age tour. the author uses verbs to make the essay lively.  For example, in the scenarios that the blind man asked the wife  if he could touch the wife’s face, the writer writes  “he touch his fingers to every part of her face.” And when the husband is drawing the cathedral “ he ran his fingers over the paper.” Those scenes is vivid and make a perfect story.
          A attractive story  appeals e readers.  when people starts to reading, they cannot pull themselves out of the book because of a series of impaccable plot. For example, in Alice Munro’s short story ‘ Royal Beatings’, Flo go to find Rose’s father and ask her husband to give Rose a beating. when we read this sentence, we will want to know how serious the beating is and keep reading to find the answer. later, we can  find out Rose’s father beat her very bad actually can use tragedy to describe it, because no matter how the way Rose begging, her father  will not stop the cruel punishment and we also can know how desperate Rose is. we notice how her stepmother changes the feeling and the attitude to her. Flo begin to comfort Rose and bring a jar of cold cream to ease Rose's  pain in  both mentally and physically. A coherent story line  evoke readers interset to keep reading the story.
          I think a good story should be vivid and coherent, because they both can get readers’ attention to keep reading the story and lead a right path for readers to get into the story and get drowned by the story.
